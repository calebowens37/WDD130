        <h2>Caleb</h2>
<p>Hey guys, my name is Caleb Owens. I'm single I work fulltime at Wal-Mart in Rexburg as a manager. I'm originally from Dallas area, but I've lived pretty much everywhere in Texas.</p></p>
<p>I was born in the church, but I really wouldn't consider myself a member until about two years ago. When I decided to soften my heart and stop trying to do everything by myself.
<p>Currently I'm a manager at Wal-Mart in town, but I've always been really interested in computing, and I want a job that I can do remote while I travel.
<p>I'm a huge soccer fan, and I'm very much a people person. I'm really looking forward to learning with you guys in this class.</p>
